# Spotify DJ Analysis

### The Idea
The app will look through a persons playlist. Analyse the songs. When the person chooses a song they want to play the app will find songs that are easy to mix with that song from their chosen playlists. 

### How it works

1. User selects some playlists that they want to play music from.
2. The app will analyse the playlists and extract useful information about the songs E.G. (Genre, Key, BPM... Any other suggestions welcome here)
3. The user will then select a song they might be currently playing or want to play beforehand.
4. The app will then look for songs that match this current song by looking for feature that make them mix well together e.g similar BMP and genre etc
5. The app will suggest a list of songs to the user to play next in their set.

### Future work
- This could be used to build entire sets
- Would it be useful for DJ's 
- Is there anything already out there?
- Any suggestions on what to suggest if the user wants to change BPM or switch to a different Genre.
- Would this require soundcloud or is spotify alone good enough.
- Would only amateur DJ's want to use this?
- I think this would be good when mixing from one DJ to another as you may not know eachothers song selections so well.
